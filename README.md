   Sayudha Test Submission - VOX Slicing Test
</h1>


Hi Vox Team! Thanks for giving me this opportunity. At first, I was wondering which environment should I build for this Slicing Test, should I go with `create-react-app`? Should I just build my work environment using Webpack with Atomic Design? Should I use `Vue-CLI`? Or I just make it using Prepros?

Turns out I choose GatsbyJS, since this is just a single page, and I think Gatsby can handle it well even though I did not use their MDX or heavily use their GraphQL since this is just a slicing test, not working with API or fetching anything.

I have build this project, but if you want to run it locally, you can check the steps below:

## üöÄ How to install

Run this on your terminal
```shell
npm install
```

if you get any error, please install yarn, you can use yarn to install or not, but yarn is needed globally.


## ‚úèÔ∏è How to develop locally

1.  Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd vox-slicing-tests/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
